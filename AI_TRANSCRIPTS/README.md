# AI Usage
I used **Opus 4.5** in Agent and Ask mode to complete this assessment within the timeframe whilst demonstrating both my coding abilities and ability to utilise AI in my work.

Ordinarily I would utilise AI slightly differently. 
Notably, (1) I would create seperate chat windows for different topics. For the purpose of this assessment I kept it as one for transparency and organisational purposes. (2) I would experiment and ideate more with AI to co-produce a more precise output. For this assessment AI was mostly lent on for setting up & reviewing purposes, in order to highlight my own problem solving abilities.

There was one moment where Opus created a preprocessing.py file - this was an unintended result from my command. This file was deleted and code unused. From then onwards Opus was contextualised to only generate specific functions on demand
